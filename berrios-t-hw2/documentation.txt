1. Settings tab in the bottom left to access the filters and the visual Settings
    Visual settings are to spin kirby, the spin speed, whether frequency is being used, and the white noise which has been modified for the screen size.
    Frequency is what i designed it for so take a look at it.
2. The 2 audio nodes I added were the 2 biquad filters representing bass and treble.
3. The main sprite is just a circle sprite, but I also have a child of it, being the kirby sprite, which has an additional circle sprite.
    The kirby sprite's mouth (a circle sprite) changes its radius based on the average audio data.
4. The data i put was the title, audio files with their names, and the background color
5. The background is the same as my base audio visualizer, but other than that I changed a decent bit by adding the kirby acting as both a spinning record
    and with his mouth moving with the audio. Id give it a 10 because its fairly different from the base PE, and has a unique asthetic to go along with the music.
    I wanted to have a lot more with incorperating a swirling effect around Kirby, and making the mouth movements look more polished, along with having mini kirbys moving 
    across the screen. But I realized I haddnt given myself enough time with midterms this week, so I had to scale it down a lot (and its still 1 day late anyway).
